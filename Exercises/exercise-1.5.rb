# Given the array of hashes:

users = [
    {
        name: "John Doe",
        age: 43
    },
    {
        name: "Amy Singer",
        age: 53
    },
    {
        name: "Jimmy Lendricks",
        age: 23
    }
]
# Use a while loop to print the values of each hash such as "My name is ... and I am ...". If the first name starts with "Jimmy", print out "My name and age is confidential."
