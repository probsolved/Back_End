# **Exercise 2.6: More built in array methods** <br>
# Create a Ruby file called exercise-2.6.rb.

# 1. Print out the array built in methods

# To see the methods
# Example `puts [].methods`

# 1. Create an array that includes three strings that resemble names: "Amy", "Jimmy", "Johnny"
# 2. Use three different built in array methods that haven't been used today. Googling is recommended.

names = ["Matthew", "Mark", "Luke"]
puts names.count("Matthew")
puts names.display
puts names.grep(/att/)
